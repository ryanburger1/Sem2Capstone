## Summary 
In this project I was charged with exploring what price causes the typical cosmetics consumer to remove a product from their cart and not buy it. In my analysis I was able to take my findings and come up with the ideal price point for any cosmetic company to not sell their product above. 

## Data Science Steps 

### Obtaining 
I obtained my data from kaggle and moved it into my repository. Below I have attached a link to the data set: 

[eCommerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nowingkim/ecommerce-data-cosmetics-shop)

### Cleaning 
There was couple cleaning steps that needed to be taken before procceeding with the analysis. First, I made a seperate data frame with only the columns that I would need to run my analysis. Second, I removed any price's that were equal to zero since this would mean that they were not making a profit of the product sold. 

### Exploring 
I conducted a basic exploration to gain a better idea of what was in my data, which was helpful in conducting the rest of my analysis. 

### Modeling
Once I was done with the above steps I was able to start creating my machine learning models. I created an XGBoost model and a Logistic Regression model to help lead me towards my end goal 

### Interpreting 
After modeling my data I connected it back to the original business problem to come up with a recommendation.
